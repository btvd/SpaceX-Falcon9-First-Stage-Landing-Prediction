# SpaceX-Falcon9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction

In this project we will collect and transform data about SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches to use it for building predictive model of first stage landing success.

Current price of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch is 67 million dollars. Other providers give price like 165 million dollars each. The big difference in prices comes from the ability of SpaceX to reuse their first stage capacities. 

Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if SpaceX competitor wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
